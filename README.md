# Ransomware
A ransomware python script

The default password of the file is 'maor', you can change it in line 9 to whatever you'd like.
Be advised don't run it on your main PC!
Make sure to have the python's module inorder for the script to work, you can pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Double click the Python script to execute it, you'll see the files in the directory getting locked in a zip file
name "locked_file.zip", than changing the name to "locked_files.zip.aes".
Then an easygui window will pop telling you to enter the password inorder to decrypt the file.
